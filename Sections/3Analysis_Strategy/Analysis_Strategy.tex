The analysis follows the same strategy one used in 2016 p-Pb and pp data samples (see published paper \cite{ALICEDhcorr} and analysis notes \cite{Notepp}, \cite{NotepPb}). Correlation pairs are formed by
trigger particles (D mesons) reconstructed and selected in the following $\pt^{\rm trig}$ ranges: $3<\pt^{\rm trig}<5$ $\gev/c$, $5<\pt^{\rm trig}<8$ $\gev/c$, $8<\pt^{\rm trig}<16$ $\gev/c$, $16<\pt^{\rm trig}<24$ $\gev/c$ (the possibility of extending the analysis in $2<\pt^{\rm trig}<3$ was also exploited. Further details are furnished in the next paragraph). Associated particles (charged tracks) have been reconstructed in the following $\pt^{\rm assoc}$ regions: $\pt^{\rm assoc}>0.3$ $\gev/c$, $0.3<\pt^{\rm assoc}<1$ $\gev/c$, $1<\pt^{\rm assoc}<2$ $\gev/c$, $2<\pt^{\rm assoc}<3$ $\gev/c$, $\pt^{\rm assoc}>1$ $\gev/c$. In this analysis, the particle identification defines the trigger particle rather than a momentum cut and therefore the momentum range of the associated particles is not constrained by that of the trigger particle. Our definition of associated particle includes primary particles of the following species: pion, kaon, proton, electron, muon. The primary particle definition comprises particle coming from the primary vertex of interaction, including those coming from strong and electromagnetic decay of unstable particles, and particles deriving from the decay of hadrons with charm or beauty.
We therefore include any charged $\pi$,K,p,e,$\mu$ except those coming from weak decays of strange particles and particles produced in the interaction with the detector material. This definition corresponds to that used in the method AliAODMCParticle::IsPyhysicalPrimary().
All associated particles surviving the selection cuts and not matching the adopted criterion are considered as a contamination whose contribution has to be corrected for. \\

The analysis is performed through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\underline {\bf D meson selection and signal extraction.}  For each single event, ``trigger" particles
are defined as the selected  D meson candidates ($\Dzero$, $\Dplus$ and $\Dstar$)
within a given $\pt^{\rm trig}$ range. The detection strategy for D mesons at central rapidity is
the same performed for the analyses of the D-meson production at central rapidity~\cite{ALICEDmespp7Tev}, and also applied for the D-h analysis on 2016 pp and 2016 p-Pb samples (\cite{Notepp}, \cite{NotepPb}). It is based on the reconstruction of decay
vertices displayed from the primary vertex by a few hundred $\mu$m and on the identification of the decay-particle species.
The identification of the charged kaon and pion in the TPC and TOF detectors is also used, to further reduce the background at low $\pt$.  An invariant-mass analysis is then used to extract the raw signal yield, using the same fit functions described in~\cite{ALICEDhcorr}.
The D mesons are selected in the rapidity range varying from $|y|<0.5$ at low $\pt$ to $|y|<0.8$ for $\pt>5~\gev/c$. %The final results are corrected to have D mesons within $|y|<0.5$.

\item
\underline{\bf Correlation of D candidates with associated tracks.}
Particle pairs are formed by correlating each trigger particle with the charged primary particles passing the track selection (excluding those coming from the decay of the D-meson candidate) in a specified $p^{assoc}_{T}$ interval (which can overlap with the $\pt^{\rm trig}$ range) and in the pseudo-rapidity range $|\eta|<0.8$. For the $\Dzero$ meson, also the low-momentum pion tracks from feed-down of $\Dstar$ mesons are removed via 3$\sigma$ invariant mass cut on the $M(K\pi\pi)-M(K\pi)$ difference. This because these soft pion are not related to the charm quark fragmentation chain.
For D meson candidates in the invariant mass signal region, defined by a $\pm$ 2$\sigma$ interval around the D meson mass peak, the azimuthal angle difference $\varphi^{\rm assoc}-\varphi^{\rm trigg}\equiv\Delta\varphi$
and the pseudorapidity difference $\eta^{\rm assoc}-\eta^{\rm trig}\equiv\Delta \eta$ are evaluated and stored to build two-dimensional correlation distribution. % in a multi-dimensional histogram.

\item
\underline{\bf Correction for limited acceptance and detector inhomogeneities with Event Mixing}
The angular correlation distribution may be affected, even for uncorrelated pair of particles, by structures not due to physical effects, but originating from the limited detector acceptance, as well as from angular inhomogeneities in the trigger and track reconstruction efficiencies as a function of $\Delta\varphi$ and $\Delta\eta$.
Effects of this kind are removed using the Event Mixing technique.
In this technique, the analysis is executed on the same data sample of the standard one (called ``same event" analysis, SE), but the trigger particles found in each event are correlated to charged particles reconstructed in different events (``Mixed Events'' analysis, ME) with similar characteristic, in particular concerning the event multiplicity and z position of the primary vertex (see Section \ref{MEsection}). \\

The differential yield of associated particles per trigger particle is obtained by
\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{2pcorr_incl}
    \frac{1}{N_\text{trig}}\frac{\d^{2}N^\text{pair}}{\d\Delta\eta\, \d\Delta\varphi}
= B_{ME}(0,0)\times\frac{S(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)}{B_{ME}(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
where $N^\text{pair}$ is the total number of correlated D-hadron
pairs. The functions $S(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)$ and
$B_{ME}(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)$ are the signal and the mixed event
background distributions, respectively. The later is normalized to its value in
$(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)=(0,0)$, i.e. ($B(0,0)$).
Further details on the mixed-event correction are provided in the next section.

\item
\underline{\bf Subtraction of background correlation from signal distribution.}
The invariant mass signal region also includes background D-meson candidates. Their contribution to the
raw correlation distribution is subtracted as follows. For each $\pt$ bin, the mean and the sigma of the
invariant mass spectrum are extracted. For $\Dzero$ and $\Dplus$, a ``background'' region is defined in the sidebands of the mass
distribution as the interval $4 ~ \gev/c^2<|m-m^{\rm pdg}|<8 ~ \gev/c^2$ (for the $\Dstar$ meson, only the right sideband is used). The angular correlation distribution for background candidates in this region is extracted and normalized with respect to the background in the signal region estimated from the mass fit. This normalized background correlation distribution is then subtracted from the
raw signal one to obtain the signal correlation distribution. The normalization factor is the ratio of the number of background candidates under the signal peak (obtained by integrating the background of the fit function within the signal region) over the number of background candidates in the sidebands (obtained via bin-counting in the sideband region).
An example of the signal region, sideband and sideband-subtracted 1D correlation distributions (along $\Delta\varphi$) is shown in figure \ref{signReg}, together with the comparison of the three distributions after the normalization to the number of triggers.

\end{figure}

\item
\underline{\bf Correction for D meson efficiency and associated track efficiency.}
After filling the signal and background correlation distributions, it is necessary to take into account also for the correlations with tracks, those are not reconstructed, or not passing the quality selection due to poor reconstruction. In the same way, the loss of D-mesons which are not reconstructed, or do not pass the selection, impacts the correlation distribution shape. Hence, each pair is weighted by the inverse of the product of the associated track and D meson reconstruction efficiency, $\epsilon_{trk}$ and $\epsilon_{trig}$. Further details are provided later on in this section.

\item
\underline{\bf Projection in $\Delta\varphi$.}
The limited statistics available does not allow to study the two dimensional
$(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)$ distribution, which is therefore projected to the $\Delta\varphi$ axis by integrating on $|\Delta\eta| <$ 1. Despite, in principle, our maximum $\Delta\eta$ acceptance is of $|\Delta\eta| <$ 1.6, removing the large $|\Delta\eta|$ regions allow us to reject angular regions with very low statistics, where fluctuations would be amplified by a large mixed-event correction, and avoid the so-called wings effect.

As the difference in the azimuthal angle is periodic ($\Delta \varphi = 0 = 2\pi$), the $\Delta\varphi$-range is limited to the essential range of 2$\pi$. The $\Delta \varphi$-limits are chosen to be [$-\pi$/2, 3$\pi$/2] in order to provide a good visibility of the correlation pattern, which peaks around 0 and $\pi$.

\item
\underline{\bf Correction for the contamination of secondary particles}
The DCA to primary vertex cut, applied during the associated track selection, has the role of removing the secondary particles from the associated track sample.
Secondary particles are indeed produced either from long-lived strange hadrons or from interaction of particles with the detector material. A residual contamination from secondary tracks is hence expected in the correlation distributions. This contamination is estimated from Monte Carlo simulation based on Pythia as described more in detail in the next section. The background-subtracted
event-mixing corrected correlations are multiplied by a purity factor to encounter this contribution.

\item
\underline{\bf Correction for bias on B to D decay topologies}
The presence of the topological cuts for the D-meson selection indirecly induce a bias on the topology of the B to D decay topologies, favouring cases with a small opening angle between the D-meson and the other tracks from the B decay. This affects the feed-down component of the data correlation distributions. This effect is corrected for with a procedure described in the subsection \ref{MCclosure}. %Note that this correction is a novelty with respect to the previous analyses, where only a quite conservative systematic uncertainty was applied to take into account this effect.

\item
\underline{\bf Correction for feed-down of D meson from b-hadron decay}
The selection strategy employed for the D meson candidates selection %to increase the signal over the combinatorial background
enhances the fraction of reconstructed D mesons coming from the decay of a b-hadron. Typical values, with the cuts used for the D-meson selection, are of the order of 10\% or less. The correlation distribution of these secondary D mesons will be sensitive to the properties of beauty jets and beauty hadron decay, which in general differ from those relative to charm jets and hadrons. The procedure used to subtract this contribution is described in the next paragraphs of this section.

\item
\underline{\bf Study of correlation properties.}
The properties of the azimuthal correlation distribution are quantified by fitting the distribution with a function composed of two Gaussian functions, modelling the near and the away side peaks, and a constant term describing the baseline. The mean of the Gaussian are fixed at $\Delta\varphi = 0$ and $\Delta\varphi = \pi$. To accomplish the $2\pi$ periodicity of the $\Delta\varphi$ variable, the Gaussian functions are ``duplicated'' with mean at $\Delta\varphi = 2\pi$ and $\Delta\varphi = -\pi$.
The fitting procedure is described in details in Section \ref{results}.


%The integral of the near side peak and the away side peak
%is dominated by the central parts of the peaks at
%$\Delta \varphi = 0$ and $\Delta \varphi = \pi$, respectively. Thus, minor
%shape deviations at the side of the peak regions are  acceptable. In
%the following, the fit function is introduced step by step.
%The $\Delta \varphi$ distribution can roughly be approximated by a
%constant and two Gaussian functions with the periodicity condition.
%As the $\Delta \varphi$-distribution is a periodically continuing
%distribution with $\Delta\varphi = 0 = 2\pi$, the fit function has to
%be periodically continuing as well.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mass plots and cut optimization}
The invariant mass distributions of $\Dzero$, $\Dstar$ and $\Dplus$ in the various $\text{p}_T$ ranges are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:InvMassD0},~\ref{fig:InvMassDs} and~\ref{fig:InvMassDp} respectively. Note that the distributions are weighted by the D-meson selection and reconstruction efficiency, to allow a correct normalization of the correlation distributions, which have also these weights.

\end{figure}

For the $\Dstar$, 3 sets of cuts were compared (the 2016 p-Pb, 2016 pp and the standard D2H 2017 pp cuts). The best performance was obtained with 2016 p-Pb cuts in most of the $pt$ bin analysed. Indeed, despite the looser cuts applied from D2H allow to have higher signal, the p-Pb set of cuts assured a better S/B factor without loosing too much signal. This allows us to reduce fluctuations induced by the sideband subraction, that is the limiting factor for the analysis performance.
The same holds for the $\Dplus$, but with the addition of cuts on the normalized decay length in $xy$ plane and of the normalized difference between measured and expected daughter track impact parameters (topomatic cut).
A particular cut optimization was instead performed for the $\Dzero$ meson. Twelve cut sets were tried, with the goal of increasing the S/B factor, in order to reduce fluctuations induced by the sideband subraction as explained.
In Figure \ref{fig:cutoptD0} the $\Dzero$-h correlation distributions are shown for the different cut sets, in exemplary kinematic regions (left column), together with the bin-by-bin relative statistical uncertainty on the data points (right column). The best cut set (option G) was defined from the standard cuts used for the p-Pb 2013 cross section analysis, with a tightened selection on the cosine of the pointing angle, and with the addition of a cut on the normalized decay length in $xy$ plane and of a selection on the normalized difference between measured and expected daughter track impact parameters (topomatic cut).

 \subsubsection{Extension to vey-low $\pt$ of D mesons}
 
Thanks to the higher statistic of the 2017 pp data sample, we tried to enlarge our correlation studies to very-low $\pt$ of the trigger particle. Indeed, the figure \ref{fig:VeryLowPt} shows the good performance on the invariant mass extraction for all the 3 D-mesons with $2< p_{T}^{\text{D}}< 3$ $\gev/c$.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering

\label{fig:VeryLowPt}
\end{figure}

The extension of the analysis to this $\pt$ interval is of high interest in the jet structure characterizion. Indeed, this study allow us to investigate a kinematic region in which the trigger particle has compatible or even lower momentum with respect to the associated particles. This give us the possibility to better understand the production processes. In fact, for example, at the Leading Order (LO) for $\pt (trig) \sim \pt(ass)$ we don't expect any peak on the near-side region. A peak could arise only from Next-to-Leading-Order production process.

Despite the good statistics, it wasn't enough to perform the correlation analysis. Indeed, the correlation distribution suffered of fluctuation expecially on the away-side region where most of the fit failed. 



\subsection{Code used for the analysis}
The code used for D meson-hadron correlation analysis is fully committed in AliPhysics. The analysis classes can be found in
\$ALICE\_ROOT/PWGHF/correlationHF/.  The  D meson specific classes where the aforementioned steps are carried out are
AliAnalysisTaskDStarCorrelations, AliAnalysisTaskSED0Correlations and AliAnalysisTaskDplusCorrelations. The classes which are common to the D meson specific analysis which includes the associated particle cuts and the correlation observables are AliHFAssociatedTrackCuts, AliHFCorrelator, AliHFOfflineCorrelator, AliReducedParticle and AliDhCorrelationExtraction. Several additional classes and macros in the same folder deal with the correction steps.

%The final results presented here are extracted are the HFCJ pPb (n. 88) train runs 290-293 (for $\Dzero$ and $\Dplus$) and 286-289 (for $\Dstar$).
