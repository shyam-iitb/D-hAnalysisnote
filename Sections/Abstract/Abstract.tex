In this note, we present the analysis of azimuthal correlations of D mesons and primary charged $\pi$,K,p,e,$\mu$ performed in the ALICE central barrel in pp collisions at $\rm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, from 2017 data taking. The analysis is performed in an extended $\pt$ range and with additional observables with respect to pp 2013 data analysis. After a description of the analysis strategy, corrections and systematic uncertainties, the results obtained for prompt $\Dzero$, $\Dstar$ and $\Dplus$ mesons in different ranges of transverse momentum of the D meson and of the associated particles are presented. The results are then compared to perturbative QCD inspired Monte Carlo models and also with pp at 7 and 13 TeV analysis results for the common $\pt$ ranges as well as with the 2016 p-Pb results.
